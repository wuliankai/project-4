# This app uses React, Express, Prisma, Postgres and Supabase.

# Run npm i on start up in the front-end and back-end just in case.

# Primary usage for this app is a travel information consolidation app. I have always found that bits and pieces of relevant information while travelling to be all over the place, and in different formats.

Please register a new account if you don't have one. All you need is your name and your phone number.

# After register, users will be able to log in

Upon log in, users will have access to log and track the following information:

1. Exchange rate. Different money changers offer different rates, but after we change money, we still need to rely on google to give us a rough sense of how much the exchange rate is. This feature will solve this issue by accurately tracking how much was changed and how much was received.

2. Hotel info. Save your hotel info for quick and easy access.

3. Flight to dest and flight to home data. These flights info are able to be saved, again, for quick and easy access

4. Diary. I have also created a diary for users to quickly jot and note down memorable events. Each diary is specific to each user (i.e. user 1 is not able to view and edit/delete other user's diary).
